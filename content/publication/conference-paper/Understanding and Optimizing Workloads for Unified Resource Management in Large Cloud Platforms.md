abstract: To fully utilize computing resources, cloud providers such as Google and Alibaba choose to co-locate online services with batch processing applications in their data centers. By implementing unified resource management policies, different types of complex computing jobs request resources in a consistent way, which can help data centers achieve global optimal scheduling and provide computing power with higher quality. To understand this new scheduling paradigm, in this paper, we first present an in-depth study of Alibabaâ€™s unified scheduling workloads. Our study focuses on the characterization of resource utilization, the application running performance, and scheduling scalability. We observe that although computing resources are significantly overcommitted under unified scheduling, the resource utilization
