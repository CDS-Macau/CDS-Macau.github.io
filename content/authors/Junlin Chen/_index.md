<!-- I am a 4th-year CS undergraduate student at Beihang University. I am also an exchange student at University of Macau. I will be a first-year PhD student at University of Macau in August 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Huanle Xu. -->

My current research interests are broadly in the intersection between systems and machine learning.
